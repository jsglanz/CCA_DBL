# Water flow and associated taxa interact to modulate the algal diffusive boundary layer (DBL)

This repository holds the data, analyses, and figures for a master's thesis project at California State University, Northridge by Jess Glanz under the advisemnt of Dr. Robert Carpenter. Data were collected in an experimental flume at the Richard B. Gump Station in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. Data, scripts, and output pertain to a CCA DBL study. The chemical environment of the DBL is analyzed with and without associated motile inverts in zero/low/high water flow and light/dark conditions.


Folders include:

-Oxygen profiles: Includes data, output, and script files to visualize the influence of flow rate and invertebrate presence on oxygen profiles and DBL thickness. The dashed lines on plots denote DBL thickness aka the height where the DBL met the surrounding seawater.

-pH profiles: Includes data, output, and script files to visualize the influence of flow rate and invertebrate presence on pH profiles.
