# Water flow and associated taxa interact to modulate the algal diffusive boundary layer

Code, data, and output from Chapter 2 of my Master's thesis titled "Water flow and associated motile invertebrates interact to modulate the diffusive boundary layer (DBL) around a crustose coralline alga."

Folders include:

-Oxygen profiles: Includes data, output, and script files to visualize the influence of flow rate and invertebrate presence on oxygen profiles and DBL thickness. The dashed lines on plots denote DBL thickness aka the height where the DBL met the surrounding seawater.

-pH profiles: Includes data, output, and script files to visualize the influence of flow rate and invertebrate presence on pH profiles.
